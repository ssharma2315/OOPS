        "# 1. What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
        "Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that organizes software design around objects, which are instances of classes. These objects represent real-world entities and can contain data (attributes or properties) and behavior (methods or functions).\n",
        "\n",
        "# 2. What is a class in OOP?\n",
        "A class in OOP is like a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines the structure and behavior (i.e., properties and methods) that the created objects will have.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 3. What is an object in OOP?\n",
        "An object is a real-world instance of a class. It is created using the class blueprint and contains data (attributes) and functions (methods) that operate on that data.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 4. What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n",
        " Abstraction means hiding the internal details and showing only the necessary features of an object.\n",
        " Encapsulation is the wrapping of data and methods into a single unit (class), and restricting direct access to some of an object’s components.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 5. What are dunder methods in Python?\n",
        "Dunder methods (short for Double UNDERscore) are special methods in Python that have two underscores before and after their names, like __init__, __str__, __len__, etc. They're also called magic methods because Python uses them to enable or customize behavior for built-in operations (e.g., printing, addition, iteration).\n",
        "\n",
        "# 6. Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP?\n",
        "Inheritance is a fundamental concept in OOP that allows a class (child or subclass) to inherit attributes and methods from another class (parent or superclass).\n",
        "\n",
        "# 7. What is polymorphism in OOP?\n",
        "In OOP, it allows objects of different classes to be treated as if they are of the same base class, especially when they share method names but behave differently.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 8. How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n",
        "Encapsulation in Python is achieved by restricting access to the internal state (data) of an object and controlling it through methods. This helps protect the data from being accidentally changed or misused.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Modifier - \tSyntax\tAccess Level\n",
        "Public\tself.name\tAccessible anywhere\n",
        "\n",
        "Protected\t- self._name\tSuggests internal use (can be accessed, but not recommended)\n",
        "\n",
        "Private - \tself.__name\tName mangled (not directly accessible outside the class)\n",
        "\n",
        "#9. What is a constructor in Python?\n",
        "A constructor in Python is a special method called __init__() that is automatically called when an object is created from a class. It is used to initialize the object’s attributes.\n",
        "\n",
        "#10. What are class and static methods in Python?\n",
        "Class methods are defined with the @classmethod decorator and take cls as the first argument, representing the class itself. Static methods use the @staticmethod decorator and don’t take self or cls; they are utility functions within a class.\n",
        "\n",
        "#11. What is method overloading in Python?\n",
        "Python does not support traditional method overloading as in other languages. However, it can be mimicked by using default arguments or *args and **kwargs to handle different numbers/types of inputs in the same method.\n",
        "\n",
        "#12. What is method overriding in OOP?\n",
        "Method overriding occurs when a subclass provides a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass. The subclass method overrides the parent class’s method behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "#13. What is a property decorator in Python?\n",
        "The @property decorator in Python is used to create getter methods in a class. It allows a method to be accessed like an attribute, making code more elegant and encapsulated.\n",
        "\n",
        "#14. Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n",
        "Polymorphism allows different classes to be treated through a common interface, enabling flexibility and extensibility in code. It helps in writing generic code that can handle multiple object types.\n",
        "\n",
        "#15. What is an abstract class in Python?\n",
        "An abstract class in Python is a class that cannot be instantiated and may contain abstract methods that must be implemented in subclasses. It is defined using the ABC module and the @abstractmethod decorator.\n",
        "\n",
        "#16. What are the advantages of OOP?\n",
        "OOP offers advantages like modularity, code reuse through inheritance, scalability, easier debugging, and better structure for managing complex programs.\n",
        "\n",
        "#17. What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?\n",
        "Class variables are shared across all instances of a class, while instance variables are specific to each object and defined using self.\n",
        "\n",
        "#18. What is multiple inheritance in Python?\n",
        "Multiple inheritance allows a class to inherit from more than one parent class. Python supports it directly, but it can lead to complexities resolved by the Method Resolution Order (MRO).\n",
        "\n",
        "#19. Explain the purpose of __str__ and __repr__ methods in Python.\n",
        "The __str__ method defines the “informal” or nicely printable string representation of an object, used by print(). The __repr__ method defines the “official” string representation meant for debugging, and is used by repr(). Ideally, __repr__ should return a string that could recreate the object.\n",
        "\n",
        "#20. What is the significance of the super() function in Python?\n",
        "The super() function is used to call a method from the parent (super) class. It is commonly used to initialize the parent class within a child class, especially in inheritance scenarios, ensuring proper method resolution order and avoiding redundancy.\n",
        "\n",
        "#21. What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
        "The __del__ method is a destructor that is called when an object is about to be destroyed. It is typically used to perform cleanup operations like closing files or releasing resources. However, it’s not commonly used due to Python’s garbage collection.\n",
        "\n",
        "#22. What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "@staticmethod does not take self or cls and behaves like a regular function placed inside a class for logical grouping.\n",
        "\n",
        "@classmethod takes cls as the first parameter and can access or modify class state and call other class methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "#23. How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?\n",
        "In Python, polymorphism with inheritance allows child classes to override or extend methods from parent classes. It enables different classes to implement the same method name with different behavior, and lets functions use these objects interchangeably.\n",
        "\n",
        "#24. What is method chaining in Python OOP?\n",
        "Method chaining is a technique where methods return self so that multiple method calls can be chained together in a single statement. This improves code readability and fluency.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "python\n",
        "Copy\n",
        "Edit\n",
        "obj.set_name(\"Tony\").set_age(30).save()\n",
        "\n",
        "#25. What is the purpose of the __call__ method in Python?\n",
        "The __call__ method allows an instance of a class to be called as if it were a function. Defining __call__ makes the object callable, enabling flexible behavior and often used in decorators, function wrappers, and AI models.\n",
